To begin, create your first development environment using the command:

  recode aws start <repository>

Once started, you could stop it at any time, to save costs, using the command: 

  recode aws stop <repository>

If you don't plan to use this development environment again, you could remove it using the command:
	
  recode aws remove <repository>`,

	Example: `  recode aws start recode-sh/api --instance-type m4.large 
  recode aws stop recode-sh/api
  recode aws remove recode-sh/api`,
}
